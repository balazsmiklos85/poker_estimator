# poker_estimator
ML.NET Scrum planning poker estimator

## How to use

* export data from Jira in XML format (the exported data should contain tickets
with work done on them)
* export tickets from Jira which you want to estimate
* compile / run

## What is this about?

This project is an experiment inspired by the ML.NET sample Gihub issue labeler,
with the intention to "label" Jira tickets with estimations, borrowing the
labels from planning poker. (But using actual person day values.)

## How to contribute?

Right now the project is in the state of: "if you have any ideas how this could
provide accurate results, please let me know". Issues and pull request are
welcome.
